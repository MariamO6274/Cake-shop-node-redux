// Redux
// help us manage state managment system
// when it's too much passing states between components
// props driliing (passing props to children to children to children)
// so we came up with the idea oc CONTEXT-place to store all the states
// any level componenet could directly use from context, that helped us with hardcode
// another way of this is Redux-new library which helps us to manage the states in application
